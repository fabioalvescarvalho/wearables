# The Personal Display: hardware
Swedish Team wearables' project, for the 2015 NASA Space Apps Hackathon

___Executive Summary___
The functional hardware prototype (MVP) of the Personal Display is built using the Gadgeteer prototyping toolkit and encompasses a display as well as tactile and touchless user input hooked up to a microcontroller.

___Introduction___
Digitised manuals are hard work to navigate, not least in zero gravity onboard the International Space Station. The Swedish NASA Space Apps winners countered this issue by designing The Personal Display. This GitHub page is the file depository for the functional hardware prototype, which encompasses a display as well as tactile and touchless user input hooked up to a microcontroller.

___Methodology___
The Gadgeteer prototyping toolkit was used to build the hardware MVP. The mainboard was encoded in VB using Visual Studio Express 2012.
